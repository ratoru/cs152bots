        "We built this classifier on top of Google's pretrained Bert Base large language model. We did this in order to leverage it's latent understanding of language, allowing us to train a more robust 'cyberbullying' classifier with fewer training examples than would otherwise be necessary. \n",
        "\n",
        "We obtained the following quantitative results...\n",
        "\n",
        "Accuracy: 89%; Precision: 91.23%; Recall: 96.81%\n",
        "Of all instances of harassment identified, 91.23% of instances were true positives, i.e. correctly identified as harassment. 91.23% of the positives identifications were actually correct.\n",
        "Of the total actual instances of harassment, 96.18% was correctly identified as harassment. 96.18% of actual positives were identified correctly. \n",
        "\n",
        "Qualitatively, our classifier is a little bit over-aggressive, generating many false positives. Inexplicably, messages like 'My mother fought 2 vote at the beginning of last century. Incredible women must still fight 4 equality' are labeled with concern scores over 90%. Furthermore, the classifier is extremely reactive to content which contains curse words. For example, 'THIS FUCKING POTATO IS BLOWING MY MIND. Duck fat. You guys. FIGURATIVELY DYING OF BLISS,' which we clearly interpret as a joke is labeled with a concern score of 86%.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite our decent performance metrics, we decided that Google's Perspective API would perform better in practice. Besides the more robust performance of Google's API, the primary reasons behind this decision were architectural. We would have two options to run our homemade model on our Discord bot: via API calls to a homemade server or by direct integration into the bot. The first option would necessitate getting our own server up and running which is feasible but would take additional development work and might cost money. The second option would mean running an instance of the model for every instance of our bot; given the large size of the Google Bert model, this choice is suboptimal. The Perspective API alleviates both of these issues because it is run by Google on Google servers and can be called from a lightweight bot. Additionally, given Google’s ability to collect and train on vast amounts of data, we believe their model would be able to outperform ours. Furthermore, the onus of maintaining, retraining, and updating the model is on Google rather than our small dev team.\n",
        "\n",
        "If we were to continue developing this classifier, the most important thing to do would be to collect large amounts of up-to-date training data. Language tends to develop very quickly on the internet, as trolls and deviants create new forms of hate-speech in order to circumvent content moderation. If we could retrain the classifier every month, for instance, with new and modern data, we could feasibly keep up with the ever-changing landscape of hate speech and harrassment."
